What Would Sherif Do (WWSD) is a message board highlighting the great wisdom of Sherif.

Members can layout scenarios for which they are curious as to what Sherif would do. Other members can suggest answers.
Answers can be voted on by members (as long as they aren't the author of the answer).
Of course we also prevent against ballot stuffing (you can only vote an answer up one time).

Don't worry, you don't have to be a member to have fun.
You can still view scenarios and the current number of answers without being logged in.
